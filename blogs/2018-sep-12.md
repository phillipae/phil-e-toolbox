# Workflow Wednesday - BackgroundMusic

Welcome back to Workflow Wednesday! In this installment I discuss
BackgroundMusic, a MacOS volume control app.

## The Problem

Applications often produce sound while one works, such as notifications and music. Some applications like Youtube or Spotify offer app-specific volume
control which adds another level of control, in addition to the general
system-level volume control. Some apps, like Slack, aren't so convenient
to control in this way.

If you're the type of person who enjoys
listening to music or podcasts while working, it's critical to have a
careful control over volume to avoid developing tinnitus over time. As a
guitarist who used to spend the weekends on recklessly loud band practices
back in high school, I'm particularly interested in ways to avoid making my
tinnitus worse. However, this can be challenging when different apps offer
different tools for volume control, or none at all. For example, I've
often found myself being caught off guard by full-volume notifications when
my music app was turned down. As a long-time Windows user, I was used to
having some kind of built-in system volume mixer functionality, so I knew
there had to be something out there for MacOS.

## The Solution

Background Music is a free, open-source MacOS app that provides an impressive
array of audio-related functionality. My main point of interest is its mixer
function: after installing Background Music, the user is able to individually
control the volume for active apps, such as browsers, media players, and chat
apps. There is also support built in for auto-pausing media players like
Spotify or iTunes when another app plays audio, as well as for recording
system audio.

As a huge fan of effective documentation, I wanted to point out how much
I enjoyed reading through the app's README. Everything from features to setup
is covered thoroughly, and not only does the author freely point out existing
issues with the project but there's even a sizable, nicely organized list of 
other apps that offer similar functionality!

## The Results

Using Background Music has been a breeze. I find myself frequently and
effortlessly navigating up to the controls to make adjustments when the system
volume control won't cut it. It was easy to set up and does exactly what it
claims. I generally keep system volume at about 1 or 2 and then use Background
Music to further adjust volumes on an app-specific basis. I don't record system
audio or use auto-pause very often, but I do find the inclusion of these
additional features to be a nice bonus.

One issue that I have come across is when trying to use Background Music with
iTerm2. I'll have to do further investigating to see where the issue is coming
from, but since I don't usually have much sound coming from iTerm2, it
thankfully hasn't been a problem for me.
